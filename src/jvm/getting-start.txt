What is a Virtual Machine?
---------------------------
A virtual machine is a virtual representation of a physical computer. We can call the virtual machine the guest machine, and the physical computer it runs on is the host machine.

A single physical machine can run multiple virtual machines, each with their own operating system and applications. These virtual machines are isolated from each other.

What is the Java virtual machine?
------------------------------
C and C++, the code is first compiled into platform-specific machine code. These languages are called compiled languages.
JavaScript and Python, the computer executes the instructions directly without having to compile them. These languages are called interpreted languages.


Java uses a combination of both techniques. Java code is first compiled into byte code to generate a class file. This class file is then interpreted by the
Java virtual machine for the underlying platform. The same clas file can be executed on any version of JVM running on any platform and operating system.

Similar to virtual machines, the JVM creates an isolated space on a host machine. This space can be used to execute Java programs irrespective of the platform or
operating system of the machine.


Java virtual machine architecture
-------------------------------
The JVM consists of three distinct components:

1. Class Loader
2. Runtime Memory/Data Area
3. Execution Engine
