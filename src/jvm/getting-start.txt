What is a Virtual Machine?
---------------------------
A virtual machine is a virtual representation of a physical computer. We can call the virtual machine the guest machine, and the physical computer it runs on is the host machine.

A single physical machine can run multiple virtual machines, each with their own operating system and applications. These virtual machines are isolated from each other.

JavaScript and Python, the computer executes the instructions directly without having to compile them. These languages are called interpreted languages.
